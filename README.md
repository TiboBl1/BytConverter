# BytConverter v1

Little program written in Python to convert data volume units with ease. 
Also shows why when you buy a Hard Drive labeled as "1TB",
a.k.a. commercially 1000GB, you will never get a full Terabyte available.

Proudly my first one ! :D

Some misconceptions remains anyway (floating bits...), as well as need of improvements.
